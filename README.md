# â€ŒBeane
[Beanie](https://roman-right.github.io/beanie/) is an Asynchronous Python object-document mapper (ODM) for MongoDB, based on [Motor](https://motor.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/).

# How Beane can help me?
We need to get familiar with Motor to understand the benefits that Beane provides. Have ever thought about connecting to MongoDB asynchronously? Motor is here to help us, Motor is an **Asynchronous Python driver** which presents a *coroutine-based API* for non-blocking access to MongoDB. It uses AsyncIO under the hood. <br>
Now that we can get access to MongoDB in an Async way, can we map the concept of *ORM* in this sort of connection? Here the Beane shines. It makes you capable of interacting with MongoDB asynchronously through an object-document mapper (**ODM**).
